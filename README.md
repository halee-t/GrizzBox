# GrizzBox
GrizzBox is a pass-and-play game to play with friends through a prompt and response style. Friends can vote on their favorite responses to add a competitive edge and even choose their own characters for customization! The woodly themed backgrounds and characters are brought to you entirely in Pixel Art!

## About The Developers
GrizzBox was created as a final project for a Sophomore Design class at Oakland University. Contributers include Halee Tisler, Paul Costea, Collin Trevino, Deni Cara, Zakaria Hoque, and Jamen Nelson.

## Languages and Tools
The game logic was coded entirely in Java, with some use of HTML, CSS, and Scenebuilder for the frontend aspect.
